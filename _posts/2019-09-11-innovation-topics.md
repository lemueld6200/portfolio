### Crypto Currencies

What I researched was trying to
_Learn More about How Cryptocurrency Works_. The work behind
mining coins gives them value, while the scarcity of coins and
demand for them causes their value to fluctuate. For something to be
an effective currency, it has to have value. The US dollar used to
represent actual gold. The gold was scarce and required work to mine
and refine, so the scarcity and work gave the gold value. This, in
turn, gave the US dollar value.

### Pet Robots

What one of my teammates researched was how
_Robots can now pick up any object after inspecting it_
The team views potential applications not just in manufacturing
settings, but also in homes. Imagine giving the system an image of a
tidy house, and letting it clean while you’re at work, or using an
image of dishes so that the system puts your plates away while
you’re on vacation. A Robot could pick out a specific target hat
despite all of the hats having very similar designs - and having
never seen pictures of the hats in training data before.
