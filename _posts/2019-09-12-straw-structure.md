**What I was making**  
I was making a straw structure as a bridge to see how long I could make the bridge go. I worked with Justin and Michael to finish the bridge.

**Challenges or problems encountered**  
Well, the next day _someone_ just threw out our bridge. Now we have to start all over again from scratch... We lost all hope and just gave up. The bridge by now was one line of straws.
