**What was my program supposed to do?**  
My program was supposed to display a binary, 10 base and hex table.

**What happened during the coding?**  
I made a for loop, and looped through each number.

**How things went in general and/or how I felt about it?**  
Well it was kind of hard for the first task of the year...
